# Project Description #

**amsynth** is a software synth that provides a classic subtractive synthesizer topology, with
  * Dual oscillators with classic waveforms - sine / saw / square / noise
  * 12/24 dB/oct low/high/band-pass resonant filter
  * Independent ADSR envelopes for filter & amplitude
  * LFO which can modulate the oscillators, filter, and amplitude
  * Distortion
  * Reverb

Currently it runs as a stand-alone application on Linux, supporting **OSS**, **ALSA** and **JACK** for Audio / MIDI I/O.

It is also available as a **DSSI** and **LV2** plug-in.
